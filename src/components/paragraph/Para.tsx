            <p>The holiday
                of Mardi Gras is
                celebrated in all of Louisiana, including the city of New Orleans. Celebrations are concentrated
                for
                about two weeks before and through Shrove Tuesday, the day before Ash Wednesday (the start of
                lent
                in the Western Christian tradition). Usually there is one major parade each day (weather
                permitting); many days have several large parades.
                The largest and most elaborate parades take place the last five days of the
                Mardi Gras season. In the final week, many events occur throughout New Orleans and surrounding
                communities,
                including parades and balls (some of them masquerade balls). The parades in New Orleans are
                organized by
                social clubs known as krewes; most follow the same parade schedule and route each year. The
                earliest-established krewes were the Mistick Krewe of Comus, the earliest, Rex, the Knights of
                Momus
                and
                the Krewe of Proteus.
                Several modern "super krewes" are well known for holding large parades and
                events
                (often featuring celebrity guests), such as the Krewe of Endymion, the Krewe of Bacchus, as well
                as
                the
                Zulu Social Aid & Pleasure Clubâ€”a predominantly African American krewe. Float riders
                traditionally
                toss
                throws into the crowds. The most common throws are strings of colorful plastic beads, doubloons,
                decorated plastic "throw cups", Moon Pies, and small inexpensive toys.
                Major krewes follow the same
                parade schedule and route each year. While many tourists center their Carnival season activities
                on
                Bourbon Street, major parades originate in the Uptown and Mid-City districts and follow a route
                along
                St. Charles Avenue and Canal Street, on the upriver side of the French Quarter. Faubourg Marigny
                and
                French Quarter in the weekends preceding Mardi Gras day. Mardi Gras day traditionally concludes
                with
                the
                "Meeting of the Courts" between Rex and Comus.
